1
00:02.350 --> 00:06.720
Rauffen:Finally, the day has come, Lady Rozemyne!

2
00:06.750 --> 00:08.750
Rozemyne:Professor Rauffen…

3
00:08.770 --> 00:14.250
Rauffen:I never imagined that a bride-taking ditter would take place in the Royal Academy!

4
00:14.270 --> 00:16.900
Rozemyne:Neither did I…

5
00:16.930 --> 00:20.700
Hannelore:I truly apologize, Lady Rozemyne.

6
00:20.720 --> 00:24.420
Hannelore:My brother stomped all over your good intentions…

7
00:24.450 --> 00:33.000
Rozemyne:Lady Hannelore, is Aub Dunkelfelger okay with putting your marriage on the line for this match?

10
00:33.030 --> 00:37.420
Hannelore:“I could not shame us all by interrupting what must be decided through ditter.”

11
00:37.440 --> 00:39.970
Hannelore:“Do whatever it takes to win!”

12
00:40.000 --> 00:41.420
Hannelore:Those were his words.

13
00:41.450 --> 00:47.000
Rozemyne:We would have been extremely grateful if he had canceled things…

14
00:47.000 --> 00:49.930
Lestilaut:*After saying that, Rozemyne lowered her gaze.*

15
00:49.960 --> 00:59.240
Lestilaut:*Her golden eyes, filled with sorrow, her hair, the same color as the night sky, and her porcelain-like white skin.*

18
01:00.190 --> 01:06.000
Lestilaut:*They perfectly matched the image of Rozemyne that was etched in my mind.*

20
01:06.000 --> 01:11.620
Lestilaut:*Even now, I can vividly imagine it when I close my eyes.*

21
01:11.650 --> 01:24.000
Lestilaut:*The feystones sparkling brightly, decorating her in a multitude of colors that filled me with the urge to depict Rozemyne’s dedication whirl.*

25
01:25.670 --> 01:27.390
Kenntrips:Lord Lestilaut…

26
01:27.420 --> 01:29.620
Lestilaut:What is it, Kenntrips?

27
01:29.650 --> 01:37.700
Kenntrips:If you are putting such an effort in that illustration, are you perhaps seeking Lady Rozemyne as your first wife?

29
01:37.720 --> 01:39.640
Kenntrips:Have you actually fallen in love with her…?

30
01:39.670 --> 01:41.730
Lestilaut:What a foolish notion.

31
01:41.750 --> 01:46.460
Lestilaut:How can anyone fall for a child who has not even developed mana sensing?

32
01:46.480 --> 01:48.420
Kenntrips:That may be true, but…

33
01:48.440 --> 01:57.120
Lestilaut:I must capture her beauty and serenity in its entirety. Until then, the pounding of my heart and the movement of my hands won’t stop.

35
01:57.150 --> 01:59.000
Lestilaut:That is all there is to it.

36
01:59.000 --> 02:04.750
Kenntrips:Putting aside any discussion of romantic inclinations, might I suggest courting her regardless?

37
02:04.770 --> 02:08.600
Kenntrips:Such a union would clearly bring tremendous wealth to our duchy.

38
02:08.630 --> 02:12.530
Kenntrips:Everyone would welcome Lady Rozemyne as your first wife.

39
02:12.550 --> 02:17.480
Lestilaut:What are you even saying? She is already engaged.

41
02:17.500 --> 02:24.610
Kenntrips:But Ehrenfest’s technology, which can create the same book over and over, is remarkable.

42
02:24.640 --> 02:28.310
Kenntrips:Dunkelfelger’s history book translation was also wonderful.

43
02:28.340 --> 02:32.810
Lestilaut:That history book should be made in Dunkelfelger.

44
02:32.840 --> 02:39.430
Kenntrips:It seems that Clarissa is the subject of much envy for having already secured an engagement to one of her retainers.

46
02:39.460 --> 02:47.730
Lestilaut:Even Mother has been paying close attention to Rozemyne, ever since she saw the book Hannelore borrowed from Ehrenfest.

48
02:47.750 --> 02:53.570
Lestilaut:First Mother, now Clarissa, I find the sharp noses and general acumen of our duchy’s women to be genuinely terrifying.

49
02:53.600 --> 02:57.240
Kenntrips:You should be terrified not of them, but of Lady Rozemyne.

50
02:57.270 --> 03:04.610
Kenntrips:She is engaged in joint research projects with several duchies, has a tremendous number of divine protections, and is responsible for numerous new trends.

51
03:04.640 --> 03:09.780
Lestilaut:Rozemyne’s value is only going to increase come the Interduchy Tournament.

52
03:09.810 --> 03:13.150
Kenntrips:But at this rate, she will soon be stolen by the royal family, will she not?

53
03:13.180 --> 03:17.280
Lestilaut:Certainly, when it comes to ceremonies, her knowledge is unmatched.

54
03:17.310 --> 03:23.270
Lestilaut:If it comes to that, the Royal Family won’t hesitate to cancel her engagement and take her for themselves.

55
03:23.300 --> 03:29.870
Lestilaut:If they do take her in, she would perhaps become the first prince’s third wife, or the second prince’s second wife.

56
03:29.890 --> 03:37.280
Kenntrips:If you court her before that happens and then perform bride-taking ditter, then the royal family will not be able to interject.

58
03:37.300 --> 03:43.350
Lestilaut:*Bride-taking ditter is held when the man proposes marriage but the woman’s parents oppose it.*

59
03:43.370 --> 03:50.250
Lestilaut:*It is a form of treasure stealing ditter in which relatives from both sides fight to obtain the bride.*

60
03:50.280 --> 03:53.180
Kenntrips:If we want to outmaneuver them, now is our only chance.

61
03:53.200 --> 03:55.470
Kenntrips:Lord Lestilaut, do you think you can win her over?

62
03:55.490 --> 04:01.910
Lestilaut:If we extrapolate from how she is being treated in Ehrenfest, then there is some hope of victory here.

63
04:01.930 --> 04:04.440
Lestilaut:Make haste, gather intelligence.

64
04:04.460 --> 04:07.330
Lestilaut:Right now, the other duchies are hesitating due to her engagement,

65
04:07.360 --> 04:14.540
Lestilaut:but we must get her into Dunkelfelger before the royal family discovers her true value and claims her for themselves!

67
04:14.570 --> 04:15.900
Lestilaut’s Scholars:Yes, my lord!

68
04:15.930 --> 04:20.770
Lestilaut:*At the tea party with Ehrenfest, I’ve set my plans in motion.*

69
04:20.800 --> 04:24.360
Lestilaut:Become my first wife, Rozemyne.

70
04:24.400 --> 04:27.560
Kenntrips:Good job, Lord Lestilaut!

71
04:27.580 --> 04:31.840
Hannelore:Brother! What are you saying all of a sudden?

72
04:31.870 --> 04:34.130
Lestilaut:Silence, Hannelore.

73
04:34.150 --> 04:38.880
Rozemyne:You have made a very appealing offer, but I must refuse.

74
04:38.910 --> 04:42.430
Lestilaut:*So far, everything has played out as I anticipated.*

75
04:42.450 --> 04:46.960
Lestilaut:If you refuse then I have no choice but to take you by force.

76
04:46.980 --> 04:49.050
Lestilaut:I challenge you to a ditter match.

77
04:49.070 --> 04:51.830
Hannelore:Brother, please wait.

78
04:51.850 --> 04:53.980
Wilfried:Lord Lestilaut.

79
04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Wilfried:If Ehrenfest wins, will Dunkelfelger give up on Rozemyne?

81
04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Lestilaut:Ditter matches are sacred.

82
05:02.000 --> 05:05.810
Lestilaut:I swear to the gods that, if we lose, we will trouble her no further.

83
05:05.840 --> 05:10.210
Rozemyne:In that case, on the day that Ehrenfest wins,

84
05:10.240 --> 05:14.900
Rozemyne:my brother, Wilfried, will take Lady Hannelore as his second wife.

85
05:14.920 --> 05:17.000
Lestilaut:What, you want Hannelore?!

86
05:17.000 --> 05:19.200
Wilfried:Rozemyne, what are you saying?!

87
05:19.220 --> 05:21.000
Hannelore:Lady Rozemyne?!

88
05:21.000 --> 05:27.990
Rozemyne:So, Lord Lestilaut? Will you still challenge us to ditter under these conditions?

89
05:28.010 --> 05:30.700
Rozemyne:Perhaps it would be better to consult with your aub.

90
05:30.720 --> 05:34.860
Lestilaut:If you think I will withdraw over such a reason, you are mistaken.

91
05:34.880 --> 05:38.230
Lestilaut:Your answer, Ehrenfest?

92
05:38.260 --> 05:40.090
Wilfried:I accept your challenge!

93
05:40.120 --> 05:45.890
Wilfried:I am the next Aub Ehrenfest. I will not let another duchy take our treasure so easily!

95
05:47.320 --> 05:50.400
Kenntrips:I didn’t think they’d put a condition like that…

96
05:50.420 --> 05:55.220
Lestilaut:They would drag a Dunkelfelger archduke candidate as low as Ehrenfest, of all places?

97
05:55.240 --> 05:57.180
Lestilaut:Don’t make me laugh!

98
05:57.200 --> 06:00.340
Kenntrips:For Lady Hannelore’s sake, we cannot lose.

99
06:00.370 --> 06:04.790
Lestilaut:Indeed. We will make them regret accepting our challenge!

100
06:04.810 --> 06:08.800
Rasantark:To think we can live out the treasure-stealing ditter from A Ditter Story.

101
06:08.830 --> 06:11.550
Rasantark:It’s exciting, isn’t it?

102
06:11.580 --> 06:17.100
Lestilaut:…Rasantark, I can understand your excitement.

104
06:17.130 --> 06:23.790
Lestilaut:It was the first time I read a story in which apprentice knights and scholars work together to achieve victory.

106
06:23.820 --> 06:26.620
Lestilaut:There’s never been anything like it before.

107
06:26.650 --> 06:30.980
Kenntrips:Lord Lestilaut, let’s pay them back for what they did to us two years ago.

109
06:31.010 --> 06:32.630
Lestilaut:*Two years ago…*

110
06:32.650 --> 06:38.410
Lestilaut:*Dunkelfelger lost the battle for the royal heirlooms against Ehrenfest,* 

111
06:38.440 --> 06:42.000
Lestilaut:*and I was admonished for not having enough self-awareness as the next aub.* 

112
06:46.650 --> 06:50.240
Rauffen:Treasure-stealing ditter is a direct analogue to protecting a duchy’s foundation.

113
06:50.270 --> 06:54.280
Rauffen:Had that game of treasure-stealing ditter been an actual battle,

114
06:54.310 --> 06:58.220
Rauffen:you would have lost your duchy’s foundation to Ehrenfest.

115
06:58.250 --> 06:59.880
Lestilaut:Silence!

116
06:59.910 --> 07:03.460
Rauffen:If an archduke loses their duchy, they have nothing!

117
07:03.490 --> 07:05.070
Rauffen:Do you not understand this?

118
07:05.090 --> 07:05.930
Lestilaut:What did you say?!

119
07:05.950 --> 07:10.610
Rauffen:Hmph! Dunkelfelger is the Zent’s sword.

121
07:10.630 --> 07:16.710
Rauffen:You should be focusing on becoming an aub worthy of Dunkelfelger.

123
07:18.860 --> 07:23.720
Lestilaut:Listen up! Now is the time to showcase the result of our training!

125
07:23.750 --> 07:25.930
Dunkelfelger Knights:Yes, my lord!!!

126
07:25.960 --> 07:28.100
Charlotte:It’s almost time.

127
07:28.120 --> 07:30.250
Rozemyne:Yes, let’s go.

128
07:30.270 --> 07:33.930
Charlotte:Brother, sister, please do your best.

129
07:33.950 --> 07:37.450
Wilfried:We will, please pray for our victory, Charlotte.

130
07:37.470 --> 07:42.970
Hirschur:Lady Rozemyne, my research environment has finally been perfected.

131
07:42.990 --> 07:48.380
Hirschur:I would not want Ehrenfest losing now.

132
07:48.400 --> 07:51.350
Rozemyne:…I will do my best.

133
07:51.380 --> 07:52.910
Rauffen:Both leaders, come forward!

134
07:54.420 --> 07:57.280
Lestilaut:May this be a nice, fair game.

135
07:57.300 --> 08:01.940
Wilfried:Our aub instructed us to do everything in our power to protect Rozemyne.

136
08:01.960 --> 08:03.710
Wilfried:We will not lose.

137
08:03.730 --> 08:08.580
Lestilaut:Ditter is the means by which a person can win what they desire and defend what they treasure.

138
08:08.600 --> 08:13.830
Lestilaut:We’ll Protect Hannelore and obtain Rozemyne!

140
08:13.860 --> 08:16.340
Rauffen:Begin!

141
08:16.360 --> 08:22.330
Rozemyne:Ascendance of a Bookworm. I’ll do anything to become a librarian!

142
08:26.690 --> 08:28.420
Knights:Geteilt!

143
08:28.440 --> 08:36.340
Rozemyne:O Goddess of Wind Schutzaria, protector of all, O twelve goddesses who serve by her side…

145
08:36.360 --> 08:39.380
Lestilaut:We will destroy them before Rozemyne finishes making her wind shield.

146
08:39.410 --> 08:40.650
Dunkelfelger Knights:Yes, my lord!

147
08:40.680 --> 08:45.580
Rozemyne:Please hear my prayer and lend me your divine strength.

148
08:45.610 --> 08:47.000
Wilfried:Next is waschen!

149
08:47.000 --> 08:49.060
Brunhilde:Yes, Lord Wilfried!

150
08:49.080 --> 08:50.080
Wilfried + Brunhilde + Isidore:Waschen!

151
08:53.750 --> 08:57.560
Dunkelfelger Knights:Ugh, the water! I’m getting swept away!

152
08:57.590 --> 09:00.870
Lestilaut:Using waschen as a delay tactic, how annoying.

153
09:00.890 --> 09:06.000
Rozemyne:Grant me your shield of Wind, so that I might blow away those who mean to cause harm!

154
09:11.260 --> 09:15.240
Charlotte:A pillar of light shot up from my sister’s divine shield!

155
09:15.260 --> 09:18.380
Hirschur:It is my first time witnessing such a sight.

156
09:18.400 --> 09:20.450
Leonore:Judithe, now’s your chance!

157
09:20.480 --> 09:22.280
Judithe:Yes, Leonore!

158
09:25.320 --> 09:27.250
Dunkelfelger Knight:Oh no! Our rejuvenation potions!

159
09:27.280 --> 09:30.000
Dunkelfelger Knight:Cough! Cough! My throat…

160
09:30.020 --> 09:32.500
Dunkelfelger Knight:Don’t breathe it in! It makes your extremities go numb!

161
09:33.520 --> 09:40.020
Lestilaut:Do not falter! We learned two years ago that Rozemyne uses vicious, cowardly tricks.

163
09:40.040 --> 09:43.890
Rozemyne:*I didn’t come up with this; Hartmut did.*

164
09:43.910 --> 09:50.170
Hartmut:For Lady Rozemyne’s protection, I will put my utmost into the creation of magic tools.

166
09:50.200 --> 09:53.460
Rozemyne:*And then I produced my schtappe.*

167
09:53.490 --> 09:56.110
Rozemyne:Streitkolben.

168
09:56.140 --> 09:59.240
Rozemyne:Goddess of the Sea, Verfuhremeer.

169
10:01.970 --> 10:04.300
Dunkelfelger Knight:The Staff of Verfuhremeer!

170
10:04.330 --> 10:11.140
Rozemyne:To the gods who granted us their blessings, with our gratitude and prayers, we offer our mana.

172
10:15.480 --> 10:16.830
Dunkelfelger Knight:Our blessings!

173
10:16.860 --> 10:18.570
Dunkelfelger Knight:They are fading away!

174
10:18.600 --> 10:20.150
Hirschur:What is this?!

175
10:20.180 --> 10:22.510
Charlotte:It’s Dunkelfelger’s ritual.

176
10:22.530 --> 10:28.480
Charlotte:Originally, it’s a ritual to return blessings to the gods after a ditter match is over. That’s what I heard.

178
10:28.500 --> 10:33.450
Hirschur:I see. So, in short, she’s trying to demoralize them?

180
10:33.470 --> 10:38.170
Rauffen:Dunkelfelger’s students may have been stripped of their blessings, but they won’t be defeated.

182
10:41.000 --> 10:44.770
Wilfried:O God of Life Ewigeliebe, ruler of restoration and death…

183
10:44.790 --> 10:46.050
Hirschur:That sword?

184
10:46.070 --> 10:49.420
Charlotte:It’s Ewigeliebe’s sword, borrowed from the temple.

185
10:49.450 --> 10:51.000
Hirschur:Is this part of their strategy too?

186
10:51.000 --> 10:52.140
Charlotte:Yes!

187
10:52.170 --> 11:03.410
Wilfried:O twelve gods who serve by his side, hear my prayer and lend me your divine strength, grant me the power to protect

191
11:03.440 --> 11:06.560
Wilfried(background):Geduldh from those who would steal her.

192
11:03.750 --> 11:05.350
Lestilaut:Don’t let him finish that prayer!

193
11:05.380 --> 11:06.300
Lestilaut:Stop him!

194
11:06.320 --> 11:07.440
Dunkelfelger Knight:Yes, my lord!

195
11:06.590 --> 11:13.460
Wilfried(background):I offer thee my unwavering faith. May my highest ideals be met with praise and with lasting protection.

196
11:07.460 --> 11:08.630
Dunkelfelger Knight:Release the arrows!

198
11:10.180 --> 11:13.110
Ehrenfest Knight:Don’t let them get close! Protect him!

201
11:13.470 --> 11:17.880
Wilfried:Grant me thy divine power so that no enemies may approach.

203
11:18.890 --> 11:20.010
Wilfried:Graaaaaah!

204
11:22.870 --> 11:24.650
Dunkelfelger Knight:Feybeasts?!

205
11:24.680 --> 11:26.860
Lestilaut:Do not falter! Cut them down!

206
11:30.240 --> 11:32.770
Charlotte:Sister! Brother!

207
11:32.800 --> 11:36.160
Hirschur:From here on, it will be a contest of raw strength.

208
11:36.180 --> 11:37.780
Lestilaut:Target Rozemyne!

209
11:37.810 --> 11:42.920
Lestilaut:She has been using her mana nonstop, there’s no way she’s had a chance to recover.

210
11:42.950 --> 11:48.980
Lestilaut:Give her no room to breathe—everyone attack at once and break through her shield!

214
11:49.000 --> 11:55.010
Wilfried:Everyone, protect Rozemyne! Don’t let Dunkelfelger near Schutzaria’s shield!

216
11:55.030 --> 11:56.030
Ehrenfest Knights:Yes, my lord!

217
11:58.840 --> 12:01.740
Lestilaut:This is it! Go, Rarstark!

219
12:03.690 --> 12:05.470
Wilfried:A rainbow-colored sword?!

220
12:05.510 --> 12:11.600
Rozemyne:*I’ll die! Taking that head-on would kill me for sure!*

222
12:11.630 --> 12:13.650
Rarstark:Dodge if you want to live!

223
12:17.000 --> 12:18.500
Brunhilde:Lady Rozemyne!

224
12:25.870 --> 12:27.670
Judithe:Is it over…?

225
12:27.690 --> 12:30.890
Rozemyne:Yes, the shield is intact.

227
12:36.440 --> 12:37.440
Lestilaut:Rozemyne.

228
12:37.470 --> 12:39.070
Rozemyne:Lord Lestilaut!

229
12:39.100 --> 12:41.310
Rozemyne:How did you get inside the shield?

230
12:42.580 --> 12:44.710
Rozemyne:What is that black shield?

231
12:44.730 --> 12:47.470
Lestilaut:Dunkelfelger’s secret treasure.

232
12:47.500 --> 12:51.400
Lestilaut:This shield is made of the highest-quality Darkness feystones.

233
12:51.430 --> 12:55.520
Lestilaut:Our aub sent it to us so that we could counter your shield.

234
12:55.550 --> 13:01.190
Lestilaut:We can’t allow Hannelore to be stolen away by Ehrenfest so easily.

236
13:01.210 --> 13:04.140
Rozemyne:Is that how Dunkelfelger operates?

237
13:04.170 --> 13:09.100
Lestilaut:Obtain what you desire. Gather the strength required to win.

239
13:09.130 --> 13:14.980
Lestilaut:Change your technique, change your equipment, keep challenging and never give up.

241
13:15.000 --> 13:17.540
Lestilaut:That is the Dunkelfelger way.

242
13:18.530 --> 13:19.890
Rozemyne:Judithe!

243
13:19.920 --> 13:21.970
Lestilaut:How about getting rid of your shield?

244
13:22.000 --> 13:25.110
Lestilaut:Then this can be settled without your apprentice knights getting injured.

245
13:27.670 --> 13:32.690
Lestilaut:Now that your shield no longer serves its purpose, the battle has been decided.

247
13:32.720 --> 13:35.790
Lestilaut:Take my hand, Rozemyne.

248
13:35.820 --> 13:36.970
Rozemyne:No way.

249
13:38.320 --> 13:39.690
Lestilaut:What are you about to drink?

250
13:43.710 --> 13:46.210
Rozemyne:Nngghhh!

251
13:47.180 --> 13:48.580
Lestilaut:Was that poison?!

252
13:48.600 --> 13:51.950
Rozemyne:*No, it’s not! It’s a horribly bitter medicine!*

254
13:52.660 --> 13:56.160
Lestilaut:Do you really find the thought of being my wife so displeasing, Rozemyne? 

255
13:56.180 --> 14:01.830
Rozemyne:Lord Lestilaut, I haven’t lost yet.

258
14:03.670 --> 14:10.930
Rozemyne:Wilfried, I will handle Lord Lestilaut—go steal Lady Hannelore.

261
14:12.010 --> 14:16.380
Rozemyne:I entrust Ehrenfest’s victory to you.

263
14:17.560 --> 14:18.560
Rozemyne:Lanze!

264
14:19.140 --> 14:21.160
Lestilaut:Leidenschaft’s Spear?

265
14:21.470 --> 14:22.910
Rozemyne:Hyaaah! Hyah! Hyah!

266
14:22.940 --> 14:26.350
Lestilaut:This is the clumsiest spear fighting I have ever seen, but your weapon certainly is dangerous.

267
14:22.940 --> 14:24.850
Rozemyne(background):Hyah! Hyah! Hyaaaah!

268
14:27.300 --> 14:28.380
Lestilaut:Wha-what is this?!

269
14:29.990 --> 14:31.280
Lestilaut:My shield turned into gold dust?!

270
14:32.040 --> 14:34.790
Lestilaut:Rozemyne, what have you done?!

271
14:34.820 --> 14:41.180
Rozemyne:Is it not obvious that exposing Geduldh would end with her being stolen by Flutrane?

273
14:41.210 --> 14:44.570
Rozemyne:This seems to me like an incident invited by Ewigeliebe’s carelessness.

274
14:45.920 --> 14:49.330
Rozemyne:With this, Ehrenfest will not lose.

275
14:50.060 --> 14:53.860
Rozemyne:Now if Wilfried can steal Lady Hannelore…

276
14:53.880 --> 14:56.960
Hirschur:Something is coming from above—everyone, be careful!

278
14:58.320 --> 15:01.130
Intruder:The Saint of Ehrenfest belongs to the victor!

279
15:01.160 --> 15:03.560
Intruder:We won’t let Dunkelfelger have her!

280
15:03.580 --> 15:08.440
Rozemyne:Orange and dark purple capes…?

282
15:08.460 --> 15:12.210
Intruder:Destroy anyone who opposes the Zent!

283
15:12.240 --> 15:14.960
Charlotte:There are even Sovereign Knights among them!

284
15:14.980 --> 15:16.480
Hirschur:Good Grief…

285
15:16.510 --> 15:20.150
Hirschur:Whenever Lady Rozemyne is involved, something always happens.

286
15:20.700 --> 15:23.720
Intruders:Let’s fulfill the Zent’s wish!

287
15:25.130 --> 15:27.780
Lestilaut:DO NOT INTERFERE!

288
15:30.460 --> 15:33.120
Wilfried:Lady Hannelore, it’s dangerous here.

289
15:33.150 --> 15:34.710
Wilfried:Please come to Ehrenfest.

290
15:34.740 --> 15:38.510
Hannelore:But I cannot leave this base…

291
15:38.540 --> 15:42.100
Wilfried:Our game can’t continue after such an interruption.

292
15:42.130 --> 15:46.130
Wilfried:Please, Lady Hannelore. Think of your safety above all else.

293
15:46.160 --> 15:47.900
Hannelore:Lord Wilfried…

294
15:47.920 --> 15:49.990
Wilfried:Now, take my hand.

295
15:50.010 --> 15:54.160
Hannelore:Very well. I shall go to Ehrenfest.

297
15:55.130 --> 16:02.090
Rozemyne:*Quietly, amidst the attackers’ onslaught, the outcome of the ditter match had been decided.*

299
16:07.650 --> 16:09.600
Rauffen:ATTENTIOOON!

300
16:10.090 --> 16:14.050
Rauffen:Why is the Sovereign Knight’s Order interfering with a game of ditter?!

301
16:14.080 --> 16:19.200
Rauffen:We’ve confirmed via ordonnanz that the royal family didn’t order you to come!

303
16:19.230 --> 16:29.880
Intruder:The royal family is concerned about Dunkelfelger potentially taking the Saint of Ehrenfest, dealing with such concerns is the duty of the Sovereign Knight’s Order.

306
16:29.900 --> 16:30.790
Intruders:That’s right!

307
16:30.800 --> 16:35.860
Rauffen:You would attack on such a flimsy basis, without a royal decree?!

309
16:35.880 --> 16:38.170
Rauffen:This is clearly abnormal!

310
16:38.200 --> 16:44.130
Intruder:The Sovereign Knight’s Order serves the Zent himself, we work to ease his distress.

312
16:44.160 --> 16:47.890
Intruder:Eliminate all those who oppose him!

313
16:47.910 --> 16:52.390
Lestilaut:Interrupting ditter without a royal decree is unprecedented behavior!

315j
16:52.420 --> 16:55.240
Lestilaut:Bind them and have them explain themselves before the Zent!

316
16:55.260 --> 16:56.230
Dunkelfelger Knights:Yes, my lord!

317
16:56.250 --> 16:57.540
Intruder:Professor Rauffen!

318
16:57.570 --> 16:59.980
Intruder:This is what the royal family wants.

319
17:00.000 --> 17:04.300
Intruder:If we win, we obtain the Saint of Ehrenfest.

320
17:04.330 --> 17:06.310
Rauffen:There is no royal decree!

321
17:06.340 --> 17:11.890
Rauffen:If you support the Sovereign Knight’s Order knowing this, even being Royal Academy students won’t grant you protection!

323
17:11.920 --> 17:13.530
Rauffen:Stand down at once!

324
17:13.550 --> 17:14.570
Intruder:Huh?

325
17:18.080 --> 17:24.550
Anastasius:I came here at once upon receiving Rauffen’s ordonnanz, and what do I see?!

327
17:24.570 --> 17:26.600
Rozemyne:Prince Anastasius!

328
17:26.630 --> 17:35.920
Anastasius:I wish to hear your cases, archduke candidates of Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest, stay here with your retainers and dormitory supervisors.

331
17:38.990 --> 17:41.770
Rihyarda:Milady! What’s wrong?!

332
17:41.800 --> 17:48.010
Rozemyne:I used too much mana, and drank too many rejuvenation potions. I’m feeling…

335
17:48.040 --> 17:49.990
Rihyarda:We must return to the dormitory at once.

336
17:50.020 --> 17:52.700
Rozemyne:But I was ordered to stay…

338
17:52.730 --> 17:58.270
Anastasius:You may leave. I can tell from looking at you that you are unwell.

340
17:58.290 --> 18:04.480
Rozemyne:I thank you. Your magnanimous heart fills me with gratitude.

342
18:07.370 --> 18:15.920
Rozemyne:*I’m going to faint! Collapsing in front of the royal family isn’t good! What should I do?!*

345
18:16.550 --> 18:18.920
Anastasius:Take her away already!

346
18:18.950 --> 18:20.830
Rihyarda:Yes, right away!

347
18:21.630 --> 18:25.880
Rozemyne:*And so, I was carried away by Rihyarda.*

348
18:31.380 --> 18:33.840
Wilfried:Rozemyne, are you feeling any better?

349
18:33.860 --> 18:38.600
Rozemyne:Yes, I’m sorry that I worried you, Wilfried.

351
18:38.620 --> 18:42.740
Charlotte:I am really glad you have recovered, sister.

352
18:42.760 --> 18:47.010
Rozemyne:It wasn’t until three days later that I was able to get out of bed.

353
18:47.800 --> 18:51.110
Charlotte:Sister, there is much to report.

354
18:51.140 --> 18:54.710
Rozemyne:This pertains to the inquiry with Prince Anastasius, I assume.

355
18:56.160 --> 19:00.100
Wilfried:He…feels I’m not capable of protecting you.

357
19:00.120 --> 19:01.690
Rozemyne:What on earth…

358
19:01.710 --> 19:08.390
Charlotte:As it turns out, Prince Hildebrand mentioned our ditter game to the Sovereign Knight’s Order.

360
19:08.410 --> 19:16.510
Charlotte:Dunkelfelger is trying to steal the Saint of Ehrenfest, even though her engagement had already been approved by the king.

362
19:16.530 --> 19:26.630
Rozemyne:*Oh, come to think of it, when I went to investigate Verfuhremeer’s staff, I might have discussed our ditter game with Prince Hildebrand.*

365
19:26.650 --> 19:34.460
Charlotte:If Ehrenfest is prepared to send you to another duchy, then the royal family would rather take you for themselves.

367
19:34.490 --> 19:41.960
Wilfried:If we cause another fuss like this in the Royal Academy, they will take you.

369
19:41.980 --> 19:44.620
Rozemyne:*Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!*

370
19:44.650 --> 19:47.750
Wilfried:And regarding what they will do with the intruders.

371
19:48.690 --> 19:54.370
Rozemyne:*It seems the Sovereign knights will receive a harsh punishment.*

373
19:54.390 --> 19:57.750
Charlotte:The actions of the students from the middle and lesser duchies, though, are being overlooked.

374
19:57.780 --> 20:01.110
Wilfried:Professor Rauffen really broke his back for them…

375
20:01.130 --> 20:02.990
Rozemyne:He did?

376
20:03.020 --> 20:07.450
Wilfried:He defended them by stating that the students merely believed they were carrying out the will of the Zent. 

377
20:07.470 --> 20:11.800
Rozemyne:*I thought he only cared for ditter…*

378
20:11.830 --> 20:20.320
Wilfried:But more importantly, the Zent’s wrath and disappointment were extreme since he thought of them as loyal vassals before.

381
20:20.340 --> 20:23.040
Rozemyne:I don’t understand that part…

382
20:23.070 --> 20:29.250
Rozemyne:It seems odd to me that such loyal knights would suddenly start acting of their own accord and without a royal decree…

384
20:29.660 --> 20:32.430
Matthias:Lady Rozemyne, if I may.

386
20:32.460 --> 20:34.610
Rozemyne:What is it, Matthias?

387
20:34.630 --> 20:39.460
Matthias:There is no concrete evidence, but it is possible that trug was used on them.

389
20:39.480 --> 20:41.380
Wilfried:No way!

390
20:44.190 --> 20:51.030
Rozemyne:*Trug is a plant that could be used to disturb memories and create hallucinations.*

392
20:51.780 --> 20:55.780
Matthias:I noticed a sweet scent coming from the restrained knights.

393
20:55.810 --> 20:59.060
Matthias:At the time, I couldn’t quite pinpoint why the smell seemed familiar,

394
20:59.090 --> 21:03.030
Matthias:but it came back to me when I returned to the dormitory and saw the fireplace.

395
21:03.050 --> 21:04.760
Matthias:I’m sure of it…

396
21:04.780 --> 21:09.060
Matthias:It’s the same scent that filled the air during the Georgine faction’s meeting.

397
21:09.750 --> 21:14.390
Matthias:We might be able to tell for sure if we could observe their memories.

399
21:14.420 --> 21:20.760
Wilfried:Lets ask Aub Ehrenfest for his permission before we inform the royal family that trug might have been used.

401
21:20.780 --> 21:27.720
Rozemyne:*Lady Georgine was connected to someone who was in a position to manipulate knights from the Sovereign Knight’s Order.*

403
21:27.740 --> 21:35.530
Rozemyne:*A feeling of unease stirred in my chest, and I tenderly ran my fingers over my hairpin crafted from rainbow-colored feystones.*

405
21:35.550 --> 21:39.580
Leonore:Lady Rozemyne, I can understand your nervousness.

406
21:39.600 --> 21:45.100
Leonore:But let us leave this to the aub, and instead think about what you should be doing, shall we?

408
21:45.130 --> 21:48.030
Rozemyne:What I should be doing?

409
21:48.050 --> 21:51.800
Leonore:Isn’t the Interduchy Tournament coming up soon?

410
21:51.830 --> 21:53.050
Rozemyne:Ah!

411
21:53.070 --> 21:55.700
Charlotte:What’s the matter, sister?!

412
21:55.730 --> 22:00.460
Rozemyne:*I can’t believe I forgot something so important!*

413
22:00.480 --> 22:02.780
Rihyarda:You wish to prepare benches for them?

414
22:02.810 --> 22:10.200
Rozemyne:Yes, for the Interduchy Tournament. Ferdinand will spend the night in the tea party room, yes?

416
22:10.220 --> 22:15.770
Rihyarda:It couldn’t be helped since Ahrensbach retainers will be accompanying him as well.

418
22:15.790 --> 22:21.510
Rozemyne:I want to make things as comfortable for Ferdinand as possible.

419
22:21.530 --> 22:25.350
Rozemyne:Is there anything they need other than benches?

420
22:26.470 --> 22:30.920
Rihyarda:You can leave such preparations to the attendants.

421
22:30.950 --> 22:35.170
Rozemyne:*When I relayed that to Professor Hirschur.*

422
22:35.760 --> 22:40.270
Hirschur:So Ferdinand is going to be here for the Interduchy Tournament?

423
22:40.290 --> 22:44.130
Hirschur:He’s not just going to escort his fiancée during her graduation ceremony?

424
22:44.160 --> 22:50.070
Rozemyne:Lady Detlinde asked Ferdinand to greet her on the morning of her graduation ceremony.

425
22:50.100 --> 22:54.920
Rozemyne:That is why he cannot stay in the Ahrensbach Dormitory…

426
22:54.940 --> 23:00.760
Hirschur:Oh my. To think Ferdinand would agree to play along with such selfishness…

428
23:00.780 --> 23:04.610
Rozemyne:It must be hard to stay in Lady Detlinde’s good graces.

429
23:04.630 --> 23:07.300
Hirschur:He must truly wish to return to Ehrenfest.

430
23:07.320 --> 23:08.010
Rozemyne:What?

431
23:08.040 --> 23:15.130
Hirschur:Otherwise, he would simply feed her a clever line or two, to secure himself a place in the Ahrensbach dormitory.

433
23:15.150 --> 23:20.980
Hirschur:The fact that he has instead chosen to endure a night on a bench in a tea party room means that he dearly wishes to return to Ehrenfest.

434
23:21.000 --> 23:29.670
Rozemyne:*Hirschur knew Ferdinand a lot better than I did. And while that made me feel happy,*

436
23:29.700 --> 23:34.410
Rozemyne:*it also made me feel sad at the same time. It was somewhat a strange feeling.*

437
23:34.430 --> 23:38.160
Rozemyne:*Then, Professor Hirschur said this:*

438
23:39.620 --> 23:44.900
Hirschur:Until a few years ago, Ehrenfest was near the bottom of the rankings. Its position only rose after the civil war. 

440
23:44.920 --> 23:50.650
Hirschur:And then, in what must seem like in the blink of an eye, it broke out of the lower ranks and is forming connections with the royal family.

442
23:50.680 --> 23:54.800
Hirschur:I expect the number of envious duchies is far greater than you expect.

443
23:54.820 --> 23:55.850
Rozemyne:Eh?

444
23:55.870 --> 24:05.960
Hirschur:The never-ending stream of new trends, and your joint research with the greater duchies. Everyone understands that these came about due to your efforts, Lady Rozemyne.

447
24:08.390 --> 24:12.430
Rozemyne:…I wouldn’t have been able to do any of that on my own.

448
24:12.460 --> 24:16.530
Hirschur:But they are things that could not have happened without you.

449
24:16.550 --> 24:22.280
Hirschur:I personally like seeing Ehrenfest, as united as it is under you, Lady Rozemyne.

450
24:22.300 --> 24:29.690
Hirschur:That is why I must ask you to take care. Do not lose sight of your surroundings.

452
24:29.720 --> 24:30.790
Rozemyne:I understand.

453
24:30.820 --> 24:34.510
Hirschur:Then please deliver these to him.

454
24:34.540 --> 24:40.870
Hirschur:This is a transcription of the research already done on Schwartz and Weiss, and these additional documents contain my own findings.

455
24:40.890 --> 24:46.580
Rozemyne:Professor Hirschur, is your intention to keep Ferdinand from getting enough sleep?

456
24:46.610 --> 24:54.330
Hirschur:Are you not doing that already, Lady Rozemyne? Your every action only adds to his headaches.

458
24:54.350 --> 25:01.450
Hirschur:Inviting the royal family to a ritual, gambling your marriage on a game of ditter with Dunkelfelger…

460
25:01.480 --> 25:04.380
Hirschur:He could lecture you all night and it will not be enough.

461
25:04.400 --> 25:05.620
Rozemyne:Ah!

462
25:05.620 --> 25:05.620
Rozemyne:*At that moment, in my mind…*

464
25:09.030 --> 25:12.320
Ferdinand:Your letters stopped arriving all of a sudden.

465
25:12.350 --> 25:16.110
Ferdinand:Do not tell me something happened that you dare not report.

466
25:16.140 --> 25:17.920
Rozemyne:*…This is bad.*

467
25:19.400 --> 25:22.710
Rozemyne:*After leaving Professor Hirschur’s laboratory,*

468
25:22.740 --> 25:27.470
Rozemyne:*I headed to my hidden room and prioritized writing a response most likely to earn his praise.*

469
25:28.620 --> 25:35.630
Rozemyne:Ferdinand, um…

471
25:37.920 --> 25:42.410
Rozemyne:*And before I knew it, the day of the Interduchy Tournament had arrived.*

472
25:47.840 --> 25:50.490
Cornelius:Good day, Lady Rozemyne.

473
25:50.520 --> 25:55.940
Rozemyne:Cornelius! Did you come to see Leonore perform?

475
25:55.970 --> 25:58.000
Cornelius:That too, but…

476
25:58.020 --> 26:02.970
Cornelius:We’re here to protect you, but we were told to be discreet about it and to have reasonable excuses for attending.

477
26:02.990 --> 26:08.820
Rozemyne:Indeed, the atmosphere has become much more tense compared to last year, hasn’t it?

478
26:08.840 --> 26:13.800
Cornelius:Yeah, I never expected the Sovereign Knight’s Order to provide such heavy security.

479
26:13.820 --> 26:15.680
Hartmut:Lady Rozemyne!

480
26:15.700 --> 26:17.200
Angelica:Lady Rozemyne.

481
26:17.220 --> 26:19.730
Rozemyne:Hartmut! Angelica!

482
26:19.750 --> 26:21.950
Rozemyne:So, you both came as well.

483
26:21.980 --> 26:28.370
Hartmut:I came to see my fiancée perform, and since I am now the High Priest,

485
26:28.390 --> 26:35.120
Hartmut:I need to properly inform her family of the change in my situation and earn their pardon.

487
26:35.140 --> 26:38.690
Rozemyne:Ah… It’s my fault…

489
26:38.720 --> 26:42.080
Hartmut:Lady Rozemyne, it’s not something you should worry about.

490
26:42.100 --> 26:46.900
Angelica:I came to see how strong Traugott has grown.

491
26:46.930 --> 26:54.530
Rozemyne:*There have been discussions about Angelica’s engagement, and it seems that the potential candidates are either grandfather or Traugott.*

493
26:54.550 --> 26:56.300
Rozemyne:*What kind of choice is that!*

494
26:56.320 --> 27:02.890
Angelica:My future husband must possess strength suitable for such a position.

495
27:02.910 --> 27:05.630
Cornelius:This is all just an excuse, Lady Rozemyne.

496
27:05.650 --> 27:10.040
Cornelius:In truth, Angelica came up with it to avoid having to memorize the names of the gods.

497
27:14.870 --> 27:18.380
Sylvester:Hey there, problem child. Causing any problems today?

498
27:18.410 --> 27:22.480
Rozemyne:Sylvester, long time no see!

500
27:22.500 --> 27:25.720
Rozemyne:You seem pretty tired…

501
27:25.740 --> 27:27.890
Sylvester:And whose fault do you think that is?

502
27:27.910 --> 27:31.320
Sylvester:Once you’re back in Ehrenfest, get ready for the lecture of a lifetime.

503
27:31.350 --> 27:33.670
Rozemyne:*NOOO!*

504
27:34.690 --> 27:38.320
Rauffen:Ditter shall now begin!

505
27:38.350 --> 27:42.690
Rozemyne:*The Interduchy Tournament had officially begun with Professor Rauffen’s announcement.*

506
27:50.000 --> 27:53.240
Sylvester:Since Ehrenfest won the bride-taking ditter.

507
27:53.270 --> 28:04.990
Sylvester:We’re going to demand that they stop trying to court Rozemyne and make it clear that we’re not taking Lady Hannelore, right?

511
28:05.020 --> 28:06.440
Rozemyne + Wilfried:Right!

512
28:06.460 --> 28:12.730
Rozemyne:*Right at that moment, Dunkelfelger’s first wife, Lady Sieglinde, arrived.*

513
28:12.750 --> 28:16.160
Sieglinde:Good day, Aub Ehrenfest.

514
28:16.190 --> 28:18.900
Sylvester:It’s been a while, Lady Sieglinde.

515
28:18.930 --> 28:23.280
Sieglinde:Printing, books, rituals…

516
28:23.310 --> 28:30.510
Sieglinde:There is much I wish for us to discuss, but let us first focus on that eventful game of ditter.

518
28:30.540 --> 28:31.470
Sylvester:Right.

519
28:31.490 --> 28:34.800
Rozemyne:*However, our discussions weren’t going smoothly.*

520
28:34.830 --> 28:43.330
Sieglinde:At the moment, Ehrenfest’s only value is in Lady Rozemyne, who introduces new trends and industries, knows an impressive amount about ancient language and rituals,

523
28:43.350 --> 28:50.680
Sieglinde:and possesses the leadership necessary to unify her dormitory despite the duchy having so many archduke candidates.

525
28:50.710 --> 28:56.910
Sieglinde:You are far from being worthy of one of our archduke candidates.

526
28:56.930 --> 29:03.940
Sieglinde:Surely you understand by now? Lady Rozemyne is too large a soul to be contained within Ehrenfest.

528
29:03.960 --> 29:11.440
Sieglinde:Geduldh chose to protect Mestionora by letting her go and entrusting her to Schutzaria,

530
29:11.460 --> 29:21.050
Sieglinde:it will be best for Lady Rozemyne and for everyone she knows if she is moved to a land where she can operate to her heart’s content.

532
29:21.070 --> 29:26.140
Sylvester:Is all this Dunkelfelger volunteering to play the part of Schutzaria?

533
29:26.170 --> 29:34.310
Sieglinde:Yes, for she will serve as a shield to protect Mestionora and Ehrenfest, the duchy Hannelore is marrying into.

535
29:34.330 --> 29:35.800
Rozemyne:*How odd.*

536
29:35.830 --> 29:41.380
Rozemyne:*This had somehow turned into a conversation about Dunkelfelger protecting me.*

537
29:41.400 --> 29:44.520
Rozemyne:*It seems Sylvester felt the same way.*

538
29:44.540 --> 29:46.140
Sylvester:This is so stupid…

539
29:46.170 --> 29:53.850
Rozemyne:Dear adoptive father, would we not benefit from some scissors to cut this rope around our throats?

541
29:55.410 --> 30:01.110
Sylvester:Certainly, it might be easier to deal with the aftermath than to continue enduring her criticisms while she takes the lead.

542
30:01.140 --> 30:03.860
Sylvester:Do what you want. I’ll take care of whatever happens next.

544
30:05.640 --> 30:16.740
Rozemyne:Lady Sieglinde, are you perhaps unfamiliar with the terms under which our duchies played ditter?

547
30:16.770 --> 30:19.510
Sieglinde:On the contrary. I was told about them at length.

548
30:19.540 --> 30:27.480
Rozemyne:Then why do you ignore the results of our sacred game?

550
30:27.510 --> 30:37.660
Rozemyne:We only agreed to the match because Lord Lestilaut gave us his word that Ehrenfest would not be pressured into ending my engagement if we won.

553
30:37.680 --> 30:40.430
Rozemyne:Be silent as losers should be.

554
30:41.090 --> 30:43.290
Hannelore:Lady Rozemyne…

555
30:43.310 --> 30:49.070
Sieglinde:For what reason did you seek to acquire Hannelore, then?

557
30:49.090 --> 30:53.470
Rozemyne:To prevent a bothersome game of ditter from being forced upon us.

558
30:53.490 --> 31:00.130
Rozemyne:It would be intolerably rude to have Lady Hannelore move to Ehrenfest, after all.

560
31:00.150 --> 31:05.370
Rozemyne:Therefore, we always intended to nullify that condition after winning.

561
31:05.400 --> 31:08.890
Sieglinde:You always intended to, you say?

562
31:08.920 --> 31:14.090
Sieglinde:Then, if Hannelore wants to marry into Ehrenfest—

564
31:14.110 --> 31:22.710
Hannelore:Mother, Ehrenfest won. Please do not bother them any further.

567
31:22.730 --> 31:24.340
Sieglinde:Hannelore?

568
31:24.360 --> 31:36.990
Hannelore:He was the first person to say he would protect me on the battlefield—the first person to offer me a choice, not give me an order.

571
31:37.010 --> 31:43.580
Hannelore:Thus, I truly wished to marry into Ehrenfest.

573
31:43.610 --> 31:45.140
Sieglinde:You…

574
31:45.160 --> 31:51.250
Hannelore:However, it is unsightly to force my wish onto them when they do not want it.

575
31:51.270 --> 31:56.500
Hannelore:Let us take a step back and start by learning what will benefit them.

576
31:56.520 --> 32:01.067
Hannelore:Bringing good fortune to those around you, while achieving your own desires.

577
32:01.087 --> 32:04.570
Hannelore:This is how a Dunkelfelger woman operates, right?

578
32:04.590 --> 32:10.320
Rozemyne:*The proud smile with which Hannelore spoke made it plain to see that she was a true Dunkelfelger woman.*

580
32:11.500 --> 32:16.690
Sylvester:We would like for Dunkelfelger to cease its attempts to secure Rozemyne through marriage.

582
32:16.720 --> 32:19.670
Sylvester:That is our foremost desire.

583
32:19.700 --> 32:24.940
Rozemyne:*After that, we discussed many things, such as Ehrenfest paper being unsuitable for contracts,*

584
32:24.960 --> 32:31.680
Rozemyne:*and that there were multiple differences in our respective understanding of ditter prerequisites and conditions,* 

585
32:31.700 --> 32:35.570
Rozemyne:*causing Lady Sieglinde to express her desire to apologize.*

586
32:35.600 --> 32:39.010
Sieglinde:It is important to maintain a positive relationship between our two duchies.

587
32:39.040 --> 32:43.530
Sieglinde:Hannelore, do you know of anything that Ehrenfest would desire to have?

588
32:43.560 --> 32:48.260
Hannelore:In that case, what if we have Lestilaut provide them with some art?

589
32:48.290 --> 32:50.330
Sieglinde:Lestilaut’s paintings?

590
32:50.350 --> 32:59.610
Hannelore:Yes. It seemed to me that both Lady Rozemyne and Lord Wilfried wanted his illustrations for A Ditter Story.

593
32:59.640 --> 33:03.240
Hannelore:I believe we can contribute to Ehrenfest’s printing.

594
33:03.260 --> 33:07.470
Sieglinde:Will that really please Ehrenfest?

595
33:07.490 --> 33:10.190
Rozemyne:Yes! I would appreciate it!

596
33:10.210 --> 33:13.240
Rozemyne:However, those illustrations belong to Lord Lestilaut…

597
33:13.260 --> 33:16.230
Rozemyne:Is it alright to use them without permission?

598
33:16.260 --> 33:24.610
Sieglinde:I would say this is an excellent opportunity for him to learn how it feels to have a matter related to you be decided without your involvement.

600
33:24.630 --> 33:29.670
Sieglinde:Compared to deciding one’s marriage partner without their approval, this is still quite mild.

602
33:31.280 --> 33:36.280
Sieglinde:Oh, I know! Should we also present that painting to Ehrenfest?

604
33:36.300 --> 33:39.330
Sieglinde:You know, there is a piece in the dormitory that he put a tremendous amount of effort into.

605
33:39.360 --> 33:41.500
Rozemyne:*She may be smiling, but…*

606
33:41.520 --> 33:44.530
Rozemyne:*She’s quite angry, isn’t she?*

607
33:44.560 --> 33:47.020
Rozemyne:*Hang in there, Lord Lestilaut!*

608
33:48.180 --> 33:51.660
Detlinde:I apologize for interrupting when you all seem to be having fun, but…

609
33:51.680 --> 33:54.190
Detlinde:Please allow me to give my greetings.

610
33:54.210 --> 33:56.550
Rozemyne:Ah! Lady Detlinde!

611
33:56.570 --> 34:02.410
Detlinde:To think that the first lady of Dunkelfelger is also here. How convenient.

613
34:02.430 --> 34:06.920
Sieglinde + Hannelore:Congratulations on your engagement, Lady Detlinde.

614
34:06.950 --> 34:12.000
Detlinde:I have to go around to every duchy’s spot with my fiancé to greet everyone.

615
34:12.030 --> 34:15.990
Detlinde:I am just so terribly, terribly busy…

616
34:16.010 --> 34:21.860
Rozemyne:*Beside Lady Detlinde was Ferdinand, who looked terribly pale.*

618
34:21.890 --> 34:23.470
Sylvester:Ferdinand?

619
34:23.490 --> 34:28.740
Rozemyne:Ferdinand, it’s been so long—Ow, ow, owie!

621
34:28.760 --> 34:33.650
Ferdinand:There is a mountain of things I wish to say to you, but I will refrain for now.

623
34:35.220 --> 34:39.660
Rozemyne:Then refrain from pinching my cheeks as well, please.

624
34:39.690 --> 34:41.140
Ferdinand:I will consider your input later.

625
34:41.160 --> 34:45.950
Rozemyne:Don’t just *consider* it; *conform* to it!

627
34:45.970 --> 34:47.130
Ferdinand:Hmph.

628
34:47.740 --> 34:52.830
Rozemyne:*And then, Ferdinand summoned a certain someone by ordonnanz.*

630
34:53.640 --> 34:58.560
Heisshitze:Lord Ferdinand. Congratulations on your engagement.

632
34:58.590 --> 35:03.460
Heisshitze:I was overjoyed to hear that you have been freed from the temple.

634
35:03.480 --> 35:06.330
Ferdinand:Ah, Heisshitze.

635
35:06.350 --> 35:14.290
Ferdinand:I am told that Dunkelfelger and many others worked together to grant me the greatest reprieve imaginable.

638
35:14.320 --> 35:23.180
Ferdinand:It is thanks to all of your efforts, that I am now engaged to Lady Detlinde, Lady Veronica’s granddaughter.

640
35:23.200 --> 35:26.170
Ferdinand:The emotions I feel truly cannot be put into words.

641
35:26.190 --> 35:27.210
Heisshitze:Huh?

642
35:27.240 --> 35:29.840
Detlinde:Oh my, Lord Ferdinand!

643
35:29.870 --> 35:33.270
Detlinde:You always shower me with such praise.

644
35:33.290 --> 35:39.630
Ferdinand:In my present circumstances, I am no longer in a position to play ditter with you.

646
35:39.660 --> 35:44.940
Ferdinand:I can’t hold onto it forever. Thus, I shall return this cape.

648
35:45.990 --> 35:48.240
Heisshitze:…Lord Ferdinand?

649
35:48.260 --> 35:52.120
Ferdinand:You have finally reacquired the precious cape that was stolen from you all those years ago.

650
35:52.140 --> 35:55.760
Ferdinand:I would expect a little more delight, Heisshitze.

651
35:55.780 --> 35:58.070
Heisshitze:Ah, I’m only surprised!

652
35:58.100 --> 36:03.030
Heisshitze:I never thought I would regain this cape in such a way, Lord Ferdinand. My wife will surely be pleased.

654
36:06.030 --> 36:11.220
Rozemyne:*Heisshitze, who unintentionally helped push the situation into the worst possible outcome,*

655
36:11.240 --> 36:18.580
Rozemyne:*was not even allowed to apologize and was forced to feign happiness, so his face was drained of color.*

658
36:18.600 --> 36:25.390
Detlinde:Oh my! And why did Lord Ferdinand have a cape so precious to that man?

660
36:25.420 --> 36:32.680
Rozemyne:*As the surrounding knights rushed to explain the origin of the matter, the tea was prepared.*

662
36:34.480 --> 36:37.780
Rozemyne:Ferdinand, please have some.

663
36:37.800 --> 36:38.800
Ferdinand:Hmm.

664
36:41.800 --> 36:50.270
Ferdinand:Ah, the taste of Ehrenfest. Justus, Eckhart, you should taste it too.

668
36:50.290 --> 36:51.690
Eckhart + Justus:Thank you.

669
36:51.710 --> 36:55.170
Sieglinde:The taste of your hometown after a long time is exceptional, isn’t it?

670
36:55.200 --> 37:06.250
Ferdinand:Indeed. I saw the joint research with Ehrenfest earlier, and I was surprised that such ancient rituals still exist.

673
37:06.280 --> 37:12.970
Ferdinand:Successfully gaining blessings due to the fruits of this research is truly remarkable.

675
37:13.000 --> 37:15.730
Hannelore:It’s all thanks to Lady Rozemyne.

676
37:15.750 --> 37:20.350
Hannelore:She mimicked our ritual, which was but a shadow of its intended form at the time,

677
37:20.380 --> 37:26.640
Hannelore:and offered mana with Leidenschaft’s spear, causing a pillar of light to shoot up into the sky.

679
37:26.670 --> 37:29.750
Ferdinand:Oh? A pillar of light?

681
37:29.780 --> 37:32.760
Rozemyne:*Ah! This is bad!*

682
37:32.780 --> 37:39.390
Hannelore:Because of that, the knights were able to obtain a powerful blessing, and so we became desperate to revive the ritual.

684
37:39.410 --> 37:41.040
Rozemyne:*Noooooooooo!*

685
37:41.070 --> 37:44.270
Rozemyne:*Lady Hannelore, please stoooop!*

686
37:44.290 --> 37:51.130
Ferdinand:Rozemyne did not include such details in her letters. I see now that she played a significant part in all this.

688
37:51.160 --> 7:58.370
Hannelore:The Dedication Ritual she performed was wondrous as well. Even the Zent was overjoyed after participating.

690
37:58.400 --> 38:01.740
Ferdinand:Oh? A Dedication Ritual, you say?

692
38:01.770 --> 38:05.820
Rozemyne:*…Please, someone help!*

694
38:05.850 --> 38:11.520
Detlinde:As for Ahrensbach’s research, it was done by Lord Ferdinand’s disciple, you know?

696
38:11.550 --> 38:12.980
Rozemyne:*…Uh, what?*

697
38:13.000 --> 38:14.880
Hannelore:Um, well…

698
38:14.900 --> 38:22.870
Sieglinde:Please excuse me, Lady Detlinde, but we were discussing our joint research with Ehrenfest.

700
38:22.890 --> 38:31.270
Detlinde:Lord Ferdinand, rather than the research done by other duchies, I need you to focus on the research done by Ahrensbach.

702
38:31.300 --> 38:38.890
Ferdinand:Ahrensbach’s research garnered much attention from the royal family due to its use in preserving documents.

704
38:38.920 --> 38:49.150
Detlinde:We put our voice recording magic tool, which we improved upon, in a stuffed shumil, and to my surprise, it whispered tender words of love in my ears. Ohohohoho!

707
38:49.850 --> 38:53.260
Sieglinde:Is she talking about the exhibition piece that was prepared by Ehrenfest?

709
38:53.290 --> 38:57.100
Rozemyne:Yes! My retainers prepared it.

711
38:57.120 --> 39:02.170
Rozemyne:The words of love are excerpts from Royal Academy Love Stories.

712
39:02.200 --> 39:04.550
Ferdinand:I received an explanation from Raimund this morning,

713
39:04.570 --> 39:11.240
Ferdinand:and I was simply exasperated to hear that it has been filled with such fool—strange messages.

715
39:11.270 --> 39:13.100
Ferdinand:So it was your doing.

716
39:13.120 --> 39:18.440
Detlinde:Lord Ferdinand, I desire that stuffed shumil for myself.

718
39:20.170 --> 39:27.110
Rozemyne:My sincerest apologies but that shumil is already spoken for.

720
39:27.140 --> 39:32.400
Detlinde:Then I will negotiate with whoever is due to receive it. Tell me, who might this person be?

722
39:32.420 --> 39:37.740
Ferdinand:Lady Detlinde, if it has already been promised to someone, then asking for it will only trouble everyone.

724
39:37.770 --> 39:47.060
Detlinde:Lord Ferdinand, I am saying that I desire this shumil. If you are my fiancé, then at least try to grant my wish.

726
39:47.090 --> 39:53.920
Ferdinand:…I understand. After obtaining a workshop in Ahrensbach, I promise to make one for you.

729
39:53.950 --> 39:59.720
Sieglinde:Oh my! It’s wonderful that your fiancé would make one especially for you. 

730
39:59.750 --> 40:02.320
Sieglinde:Isn’t that great, Lady Detlinde?

731
40:02.350 --> 40:10.970
Detlinde:Isn’t it terribly far away for Lord Ferdinand to obtain a workshop? I want it right now.

734
40:13.930 --> 40:20.260
Sieglinde:Lady Detlinde, do you always make such demands of Ehrenfest?

736
40:20.290 --> 40:26.410
Detlinde:But of course. I am the next aub of Ahrensbach, you know.

739
40:28.340 --> 40:35.060
Rozemyne:*I thought things were finally settling down, but now I don’t know what to do anymore.*

741
40:36.050 --> 40:42.490
Lieseleta:Lady Rozemyne, might I suggest offering the exhibit shumil to Lady Detlinde?

743
40:42.520 --> 40:44.940
Lieseleta:I will simply make another.

744
40:44.970 --> 40:46.940
Rozemyne:Lieseleta…

745
40:46.960 --> 40:51.880
Lieseleta:It hurts to see Lord Ferdinand so troubled, does it not?

746
40:51.910 --> 40:58.640
Rozemyne:*I nodded in agreement, and agreed to give the shumil to Lady Detlinde.*

748
40:58.660 --> 41:01.100
Detlinde:Oh my! How splendid!

749
41:01.130 --> 41:03.210
Ferdinand:Apologies, Rozemyne.

750
41:03.230 --> 41:05.970
Rozemyne:This is nothing for you to worry about.

751
41:06.000 --> 41:07.550
Ferdinand:I apologize.

752
41:07.580 --> 41:14.040
Rozemyne:*Seeing Ferdinand apologize on behalf of Lady Detlinde was even more painful.*

754
41:14.070 --> 41:20.720
Rozemyne:*Ferdinand didn’t do anything wrong, after all. And as I was feeling uneasy…*

756
41:22.240 --> 41:24.680
Hannelore:Oh? An ordonnanz.

757
41:24.700 --> 41:26.510
Fraularm:LADY ROZEMYNE!

758
41:26.540 --> 41:28.990
Fraularm:What is the meaning of this?!

759
41:29.010 --> 41:33.800
Fraularm:There was no mention of your exhibit containing such an unacceptable message!

760
41:33.830 --> 41:38.630
Fraularm:Ehrenfest intentionally deceived Ahrensbach, did it not?!

761
41:38.660 --> 41:41.160
Rozemyne:Professor Fraularm…

762
41:41.190 --> 41:44.250
Ferdinand:Did you neglect to report something?

763
41:44.270 --> 41:49.790
Lieseleta:Lady Rozemyne, perhaps they are referring to the final message you recorded?

764
41:49.810 --> 41:51.950
Ferdinand:And what was this final message?

765
41:51.970 --> 41:53.950
Rozemyne:Well…

766
41:55.310 --> 41:59.370
Rozemyne:For women who wish to be captivated by various words of love,

767
41:59.390 --> 42:04.560
Rozemyne:and for gentlemen searching for the right words to captivate the girl of their dreams.

768
42:04.590 --> 42:08.020
Rozemyne:Royal Academy Love Stories will answer your call.

769
42:08.050 --> 42:13.000
Rozemyne:Ehrenfest will be selling Royal Academy Love Stories starting this summer.

771
42:13.020 --> 42:20.510
Rozemyne:We will also be selling nail-biters like A Ditter Story, Knight Stories, and The History of Dunkelfelger.

772
42:20.530 --> 42:23.140
Rozemyne:Please look forward to it!

773
42:23.160 --> 42:30.490
Detlinde:I can’t believe such an advertisement is flowing from Ahrensbach’s exhibition—if you will excuse me!

777
42:30.510 --> 42:32.620
Detlinde:Let us go, Lord Ferdinand!

778
42:35.820 --> 42:38.330
Ferdinand:Good grief…

779
42:38.360 --> 42:41.270
Ferdinand:You truly are unpredictable.

780
42:42.490 --> 42:44.430
Ferdinand:Very good.

781
42:44.460 --> 42:49.540
Rozemyne:*Yay! I got a “Very good”!*

783
42:55.260 --> 42:57.810
Brunhilde:Lord Ferdinand has arrived.

784
42:57.840 --> 43:01.860
Rozemyne:*The long-awaited dinner time has come.*

785
43:01.890 --> 43:05.290
Rozemyne:Welcome home, Ferdinand.

786
43:05.310 --> 43:06.160
Ferdinand:Yes…

787
43:06.190 --> 43:15.960
Rozemyne:Ferdinand, that won’t do. You should say something like “It’s good to be back.” Proper greetings are important, are they not?

791
43:15.980 --> 43:17.730
Ferdinand:*It is* good to be back.

792
43:17.750 --> 43:21.950
Ferdinand:I am going to be in your care tonight. My apologies for the burden.

794
43:21.970 --> 43:26.470
Rozemyne:Ferdinand, I came first-in-class.

796
43:26.500 --> 43:30.640
Rozemyne:Two of our joint research projects also received awards.

797
43:30.670 --> 43:33.120
Rozemyne:Now, please praise me.

798
43:33.990 --> 43:37.680
Rozemyne:Ouch! What was that for?!

800
43:37.700 --> 43:43.890
Ferdinand:Is it not obvious that I must interrogate and scold you before uttering even a word of praise?

802
43:43.920 --> 43:52.780
Rozemyne:At the very least, start with some compliments. I am prepared to listen to a lengthy lecture afterward.

805
43:52.800 --> 44:01.190
Ferdinand:I do not care how prepared you are to be lectured. I would rather you grow accustomed to not doing things that will get you scolded in the first place.

807
44:01.210 --> 44:06.970
Rozemyne:That is precisely why I think you should praise me first.

809
44:07.000 --> 44:08.900
Ferdinand:You did very well.

810
44:08.930 --> 44:11.470
Rozemyne:There was no heart in that whatsoever!

811
44:13.130 --> 44:19.640
Rihyarda:Milady, how about we leave it at that and show him to his room?

813
44:19.660 --> 44:23.960
Rozemyne:Ferdinand, I brought this from Ehrenfest for you to use today.

815
44:23.980 --> 44:24.980
Ferdinand:Was it finished?

816
44:25.000 --> 44:25.790
Rozemyne:Yes!

817
44:25.810 --> 44:28.730
Wilfried:Rozemyne, what is this bench?

819
44:28.760 --> 44:33.770
Rozemyne:It’s a new creation that I asked my Gutenburgs to make, Ferdinand ordered it sometime ago.

821
44:33.790 --> 44:38.010
Rozemyne:It’s finally finished so please have a seat.

823
44:40.080 --> 44:43.030
Ferdinand:Ah, this is nice.

825
44:43.050 --> 44:50.140
Rozemyne:If you rest here, Ferdinand, then you might look a little less tired.

827
44:50.160 --> 44:54.940
Rozemyne:Just what kind of life have you been leading in Ahrensbach?

828
44:54.970 --> 45:02.250
Wilfried:He doesn’t seem much different from usual to me… I’m impressed you could tell.

830
45:02.270 --> 45:07.050
Ferdinand:Rozemyne, you don’t look very well yourself.

832
45:07.080 --> 45:09.250
Ferdinand:You have been pushing yourself much too hard.

833
45:09.280 --> 45:15.740
Rozemyne:*Saying that, he reached out to me and inspected my health as he had always used to.*

835
45:15.760 --> 45:21.250
Rozemyne:*I lightly closed my eyes; feeling his touch was actually kind of nostalgic.*

837
45:23.620 --> 45:26.220
Ferdinand:You seem to have a slight fever.

838
45:26.250 --> 45:27.850
Ferdinand:Have you not had any potions since returning?

839
45:27.880 --> 45:32.820
Rozemyne:I drank one made with kindness, so I think I’m fine, but…

841
45:32.850 --> 45:34.890
Ferdinand:Good, then.

842
45:34.910 --> 45:39.700
Ferdinand:Exercise regularly to increase your strength.

843
45:39.720 --> 45:42.640
Ferdinand:You are still relying on supporting magic tools, no?

844
45:42.670 --> 45:45.330
Rozemyne:I will do my best.

845
45:45.350 --> 45:49.330
Rozemyne:Oh… Wilfried? Is something wrong?

847
45:49.350 --> 45:54.290
Wilfried:N-No, I’m just a little surprised.

849
45:54.320 --> 45:58.190
Wilfried:Oswald, could you start preparing dinner?

850
45:58.220 --> 46:01.250
Rozemyne:*And so, dinner began.*

851
46:04.090 --> 46:07.830
Ferdinand:Is this meat from a tauchen?

853
46:07.860 --> 46:16.280
Rozemyne:Since you enjoy consommé and tauchen cooked in pome, the temple chefs made all this specially.

855
46:16.300 --> 46:17.790
Rozemyne:Isn’t it nostalgic?

856
46:17.820 --> 46:19.620
Ferdinand:I suppose…

857
46:19.650 --> 46:23.940
Ferdinand:Tell them I am highly satisfied.

858
46:25.170 --> 46:27.500
Ferdinand:By the way, that shumil…

859
46:27.530 --> 46:30.200
Ferdinand:To whom did you intend to gift it?

860
46:30.220 --> 46:32.450
Ferdinand:I will need to compensate you.

861
46:32.480 --> 46:35.650
Rozemyne:There is no need for you to apologize, Ferdinand.

862
46:35.680 --> 46:36.510
Ferdinand:However…

863
46:36.530 --> 46:39.190
Rozemyne:You really don’t need to!

864
46:39.220 --> 46:44.240
Lieseleta:Lady Rozemyne, may I suggest accepting his apology?

866
46:44.270 --> 46:48.090
Lieseleta:It would make Lord Ferdinand feel more relieved.

867
46:48.110 --> 46:49.550
Rozemyne:Umm…

868
46:49.580 --> 46:56.100
Rozemyne:If that’s the case then how would he pay me back…?

870
46:56.120 --> 47:00.590
Lieseleta:Perhaps he could make a new recording magic tool?

871
47:00.610 --> 47:03.960
Lieseleta:It would serve as compensation.

872
47:03.990 --> 47:09.830
Lieseleta:And if you could also have him record some phrases for you, Lady Rozemyne, would you not appreciate that?

874
47:09.860 --> 47:11.060
Ferdinand:Hmm.

875
47:11.090 --> 47:15.150
Ferdinand:Indeed, making a new one would certainly be ideal compensation.

876
47:15.180 --> 47:16.900
Ferdinand:I do not have much time, though.

877
47:16.920 --> 47:20.510
Ferdinand:Rozemyne, can I rely on your assistance with the brewing?

878
47:20.530 --> 47:26.230
Rozemyne:*His face, which had been so sullen and exhausted a moment ago, was now livelier than ever.*

880
47:26.250 --> 47:30.520
Rozemyne:My experience is yours, so you can count on me!

882
47:33.460 --> 47:38.350
Philine:Their preparation is a lot more thorough than what I’ve ever done!

884
47:38.370 --> 47:42.940
Roderick:They’re even matching the quality of the ingredients…that’s so advanced!

885
47:42.970 --> 47:45.950
Ignaz:Hold on, do you intend to brew it all at once?!

886
47:45.980 --> 47:49.890
Rozemyne:Indeed. I was taught that this is an excellent way to save time.

887
47:49.910 --> 47:52.260
Justus:But it does require practice.

888
47:52.280 --> 47:56.720
Ferdinand:Justus, we will be stacking the time-saving magic circles.

889
47:56.750 --> 47:58.060
Apprentice Archscholars:Stacking?!

890
47:58.080 --> 47:59.740
Justus:Understood.

891
47:59.770 --> 48:02.950
Ferdinand:Rozemyne, you draw one too.

892
48:02.980 --> 48:07.780
Rozemyne:We’re triple-stacking it? Is that even safe?

894
48:07.800 --> 48:12.610
Ferdinand:As I said, we do not have much time. Do you consider me incompetent?

896
48:12.630 --> 48:14.330
Rozemyne:No, I don’t!

897
48:18.500 --> 48:19.920
Ferdinand:…It’s done.

898
48:20.910 --> 48:25.540
Ferdinand:So, what am I expected to record for you?

900
48:25.570 --> 48:28.930
Rozemyne:Words of praise, of course!

901
48:28.950 --> 48:36.680
Lieseleta:Lord Ferdinand, if I may… I believe Lady Rozemyne would benefit from the same kind of messages she gave you…

903
48:36.710 --> 48:43.380
Brunhilde:There should be instructions for her to stop reading and to rest more.

904
48:43.400 --> 48:50.020
Ferdinand:I certainly would not mind including a scolding or two, but, what messages do you intend to leave me?

907
48:50.040 --> 48:51.980
Lieseleta:This is for you.

908
48:52.010 --> 48:54.180
Ferdinand:Justus, play it back.

909
48:54.210 --> 48:57.990
Rozemyne:Ah, later! Please check it later!

910
48:59.090 --> 49:03.500
Rozemyne:Ferdinand, are you getting enough rest?

912
49:03.530 --> 49:06.130
Rozemyne:Don’t work yourself too hard.

913
49:07.180 --> 49:16.830
Rozemyne:No matter how busy things get, remember that you need to eat. Don’t try to get all of your energy from potions; have proper food too.

916
49:18.010 --> 49:22.940
Rozemyne:If you run out of Ehrenfest meals, send word right away.

918
49:22.970 --> 49:26.820
Rozemyne:Ow, it hurts!

919
49:26.850 --> 49:30.480
Ferdinand:You deserved it. You can hand me the tool now.

921
49:30.500 --> 49:37.040
Rozemyne:No, Justus! Don’t! If you’re going to give it to him, I’d rather you just give it back instead!

923
49:37.070 --> 49:39.060
Sylvester:What’s all this commotion?

924
49:39.080 --> 49:46.670
Rozemyne:Sylvester! I made a magic tool for Justus to use, but Ferdinand is trying to steal it away!

927
49:46.690 --> 49:51.710
Sylvester:This magic tool? What did you record for him?

929
49:51.740 --> 49:56.450
Rozemyne:Ferdinand, are you getting enough rest?

930
49:56.470 --> 49:59.430
Rozemyne:Don’t work yourself too hard.

931
49:59.460 --> 50:01.410
Sylvester:…Hahaha!


932
50:01.440 --> 50:12.720
Sylvester:Take it, Justus. If you want Ferdinand to stop working, all you need to do is threaten to spread Rozemyne’s nagging throughout Ahrensbach.

937
50:12.740 --> 50:16.350
Justus:Thank you, Aub Ehrenfest.

938
50:16.370 --> 50:18.320
Rozemyne:*And the next morning.*

939
50:19.380 --> 50:22.170
Ferdinand:Here is the recording magic tool you requested.

940
50:22.200 --> 50:26.100
Rozemyne:Ah! Thank you very much!

941
50:26.130 --> 50:29.590
Rozemyne:*I immediately played the magic tool.*

942
50:30.470 --> 50:36.410
Ferdinand:It is time to eat. I do not know what you are doing but stop at once.

945
50:39.120 --> 50:42.990
Rozemyne:*Ughh… The first message is a scolding.*

947
50:43.020 --> 50:48.100
Ferdinand:Rozemyne, if you wish to listen to the rest, wait until you are back in your room.

949
50:48.130 --> 50:51.010
Ferdinand:I do not much care for listening to my own voice.

950
50:51.040 --> 50:53.060
Rozemyne:Okay.

951
50:53.090 --> 50:58.540
Rozemyne:Uh…you included my request as well, right?

952
50:58.570 --> 51:04.310
Ferdinand:As per your attendants’ wishes, I have included many words of warnings.

954
51:04.340 --> 51:06.480
Rozemyne:Huh? Then…

955
51:06.510 --> 51:08.580
Rozemyne:Did you honor my request?

956
51:08.610 --> 51:09.740
Ferdinand:Who can say?

957
51:11.500 --> 51:13.060
Rozemyne:So mean…

958
51:14.010 --> 51:18.520
Rozemyne:*And then, Ferdinand’s expression became more formal.*

960
51:19.810 --> 51:25.790
Ferdinand:Rozemyne, Rihyarda, the bench was even more comfortable than I expected.

962
51:25.820 --> 51:31.690
Rozemyne:If you were able to sleep well, Ferdinand, then the effort to bring it in was well worth it.

964
51:31.710 --> 51:36.990
Ferdinand:Sylvester informed me that you both put a lot of effort into preparing this room for me.

966
51:37.020 --> 51:40.650
Ferdinand:I spent last night in great comfort. You have my utmost gratitude.

968
51:40.670 --> 51:46.700
Rozemyne:At times like this, a simple “thank you” will suffice.

969
51:46.730 --> 51:51.150
Ferdinand:Thank you, Rozemyne, Rihyarda.

970
51:51.180 --> 51:57.070
Rozemyne:*Saying that, he smiled with a gentle expression I had never seen before.*

972
52:03.690 --> 52:08.980
Rihyarda:Lord Ferdinand, you should be going to welcome Lady Detlinde, correct?

973
52:09.010 --> 52:10.930
Rihyarda:You should change your clothes.

974
52:13.710 --> 52:19.750
Rozemyne:*And so, Ferdinand and I were separated once again.*

976
52:19.770 --> 52:28.030
Rozemyne:*At that time, I never imagined that the dedication whirl at the graduation ceremony would turn into such a commotion.*

978
52:34.640 --> 52:37.510
Hannelore:I thank you ever so much for making the time to meet with me,

979
52:37.530 --> 52:41.190
Hannelore:I realize you must be busy with your preparations to return home.

980
52:41.210 --> 52:47.600
Rozemyne:Lady Hannelore, I am also glad to have this opportunity to speak with you.

981
52:47.630 --> 52:52.450
Hannelore:*Today is the day I exchange books with Lady Rozemyne.*

982
52:52.480 --> 52:56.450
Hannelore:*As promised, I brought my brother’s illustrations.*

983
52:56.470 --> 52:59.410
Rozemyne:This art is truly wonderful.

984
52:59.440 --> 53:04.090
Rozemyne:The knights are vividly depicted performing ditter.

985
53:04.110 --> 53:07.860
Rozemyne:Each one is worthy of being illustrations for Knight Stories.

986
53:07.880 --> 53:11.800
Rozemyne:I’m certain Wilfried will have trouble choosing which ones to use.

987
53:11.820 --> 53:14.300
Hannelore:I’m glad to hear you say that.

988
53:15.470 --> 53:20.960
Rozemyne:Oh? What is this…? Is that me?

991
53:20.990 --> 53:22.110
Hannelore:Yes!

992
53:22.130 --> 53:25.530
Hannelore:It’s an illustration of you during your dedication whirling practice.

993
53:29.140 --> 53:34.900
Hannelore:*There were multiple paintings that depicted Lady Rozemyne.*

995
53:34.920 --> 53:37.090
Hannelore:*Sleeves rippling softly.*

996
53:37.120 --> 53:42.110
Hannelore:*Hair swirling and fluttering, with colors like the night sky.*

997
53:42.140 --> 53:46.730
Hannelore:*Numerous feystones shimmering and radiating light.*

998
53:46.750 --> 53:53.280
Rozemyne:Is this how it looked to Lord Lestilaut?

1000
53:53.310 --> 54:01.070
Hannelore:Your dance with the shimmering feystones was so beautiful that he felt compelled to capture it as soon as he could.

1002
54:02.550 --> 54:10.500
Rozemyne:Please tell Lord Lestilaut that I am ever so grateful he depicted me so beautifully.

1004
54:10.520 --> 54:17.630
Hannelore:*However, Lady Rozemyne had an uneasy expression and asked for the painting to be put away.*

1006
54:17.650 --> 54:23.540
Hannelore:*Did she not like it? Maybe I caused her trouble by bringing it.*

1008
54:23.560 --> 54:25.460
Rozemyne:Speaking of which…

1009
54:25.490 --> 54:29.270
Rozemyne:How are things going with you, Lady Hannelore?

1010
54:29.300 --> 54:36.300
Rozemyne:You seemed to have been heavily criticized for surrendering during the bride-taking ditter, so I was worried.

1012
54:36.320 --> 54:38.490
Hannelore:I’m fine.

1013
54:38.510 --> 54:47.140
Hannelore:My brother was very disappointed to have so much of his art confiscated, and the knights have grown very quiet since Mother scolded them.

1015
54:47.170 --> 54:50.140
Hannelore:So life is more peaceful than usual.

1016
54:50.170 --> 54:56.540
Hannelore:I look forward to reading the second volume of The Story of Fernestine when I return home.

1018
54:56.570 --> 54:59.100
Hannelore:I’ve been really curious about the sequel.

1019
54:59.130 --> 55:05.340
Rozemyne:I totally understand, it’s natural to be curious about what happens next in a story!

1021
55:05.360 --> 55:14.050
Hannelore:*As I looked into those sparkling eyes, I remembered the first time I properly met Lady Rozemyne.*

1023
55:15.390 --> 55:20.020
Cordula:Lady Hannelore, Lady Rozemyne has arrived at the library.

1024
55:20.050 --> 55:23.050
Hannelore:Let’s go right away, Cordula.

1025
55:23.070 --> 55:31.920
Hannelore:*At that time, I wanted to invite Lady Rozemyne to a tea party to apologize for my brother’s rudeness, but…*

1028
55:33.200 --> 55:38.120
Solange:Lady Rozemyne has already returned to her dormitory.

1029
55:38.150 --> 55:41.180
Cordula:Your timing was unfortunate, milady.

1030
55:41.200 --> 55:43.990
Hannelore:*And while I continued to miss my opportunities to meet her.*

1031
55:44.780 --> 55:53.360
Justus:Lady Rozemyne, I do believe Professor Solange mentioned that Lady Hannelore visits the library often.

1034
55:53.390 --> 55:59.430
Justus:Perhaps you could lend her one of your books, as proof of your friendship?

1036
55:59.460 --> 56:04.280
Rozemyne:Oh my! You are a lover of books, Lady Hannelore?

1038
56:04.310 --> 56:10.310
Hannelore:*I only went to the library to see the shumils and to look for Lady Rozemyne,*

1040
56:10.330 --> 56:13.730
Hannelore:*I’m not particularly fond of books.*

1041
56:13.750 --> 56:17.080
Hannelore:*But I couldn’t possibly tell her that.*

1042
56:17.100 --> 56:17.970
Rozemyne:Hmm?!

1043
56:18.000 --> 56:23.260
Hannelore:Y-Yes, well… I do not dislike them.

1045
56:23.290 --> 56:28.860
Rozemyne:I am quite happy to have made a bookworm friend!

1047
56:30.110 --> 56:35.970
Hannelore:*And that’s how I became named as a bookworm friend.*

1048
56:35.990 --> 56:40.500
Hannelore:*But now, I’m filled with gratitude.*

1049
56:40.520 --> 56:46.870
Hannelore:*The books Lady Rozemyne lends me are full of wonderful stories that make my heart flutter.*

1051
56:46.900 --> 56:53.360
Hannelore:*Even though I used to dislike reading, now I’ve completely fallen in love with books.*

1053
56:53.380 --> 56:59.540
Rozemyne:Lady Hannelore, is it really okay for me to borrow two books from Dunkelfelger?

1055
56:59.560 --> 57:06.090
Hannelore:You have lent me so many books, Lady Rozemyne, and I thought it might serve as an apology, no matter how insufficient.

1057
57:06.110 --> 57:08.290
Hannelore:Both are about religious stories.

1058
57:08.310 --> 57:10.650
Rozemyne:I’m really looking forward to them!

1059
57:10.680 --> 57:14.880
Hannelore:Once we finish reading, I’d like to discuss our thoughts again.

1060
57:14.910 --> 57:20.150
Rozemyne:Yes! Let’s have another bookworm tea party at that time.

1062
57:20.180 --> 57:25.260
Hannelore:*In the sequel to The Story of Fernestine, which I borrowed from Lady Rozemyne,*

1063
57:25.290 --> 57:31.210
Hannelore:*the protagonist is torn apart from the prince and forced to marry another nobleman by the order of the king.*

1065
57:31.240 --> 57:33.700
Hannelore:*But the story continues in the next volume!*

1066
57:33.720 --> 57:37.590
Hannelore:*I never expected it to end on such a cliffhanger.*
